## Aim:
Design a Basic Mobile and Web Layout for an Existing Case Study

## Algorithm:
 **1. Introduction**

**GOWSMART** is an online grocery shopping platform that simplifies everyday shopping needs with a bright, vibrant, and user-friendly interface.
The brand focuses on **convenience, speed, and freshness**, helping customers shop smarter with intuitive navigation and modern design.

**Tagline:** *“Shop Smart. Live Fresh.”*

**2. Brand Identity**

 **Logo Design**

* **Tool Used:** Canva
* **Shape:** Round (icon-style) logo
* **Color Palette:**

  * Fresh Green (`#46C17E`) – symbolizes freshness and nature
  * Bright Orange (`#FF9F43`) – adds vibrancy and energy
  * White background for clean contrast
* **Typography:** Rounded Sans Serif (like *Poppins* or *Nunito*) for friendliness
* **Logo Concept:**
  A grocery basket icon integrated with a smart digital symbol (like a Wi-Fi or spark icon) representing “smart shopping.”

 **3. Layout Design Overview**
 **3.1 Mobile Layout (for Grocery App)**

**Key UI Screens:**

1. **Home Screen**

   * Search bar at the top (“Search for fruits, veggies, or daily needs…”)
   * Horizontal scroll categories (Vegetables, Fruits, Snacks, Beverages)
   * Featured deals carousel (Bright cards with 25% off badges)
   * Add to cart button on each item (rounded icon button)
   * Bottom navigation bar: *Home | Categories | Cart | Profile*

2. **Product Details Screen**

   * Product image (centered)
   * Price, weight options, and “Add to Cart” button
   * “You may also like” carousel

3. **Cart Screen**

   * Clean layout showing items, quantity controls, and total price
   * Bright “Checkout” button with orange color emphasis

**Interaction & Usability**

* Use **gestures** like swipe-to-delete and tap-to-expand.
* Smooth **micro-animations** when adding items to the cart.
* Apply **Fitts’ Law** by keeping main actions (Add, Checkout) large and thumb-accessible.

**3.2 Web Layout (for Grocery Website)**

**Home Page Layout (Desktop)**

* **Header:** Logo on left, Search bar center, Cart & Profile icons on right
* **Hero Section:** Full-width banner showing seasonal offers
* **Categories Section:** Grid layout of category cards with icons
* **Featured Products Section:** Product cards in rows (3–4 per row)
* **Footer:** Quick links, social icons, contact info

**Interaction Behaviors**

* Hover animations on cards (lift-up or shadow)
* Sticky header with quick navigation
* Modal popup for offers or subscription


 **4. Applying Gestalt Principles**

The principle of continuity guides users smoothly through the browsing experience, starting from the banner at the top, moving through category cards, and flowing naturally toward featured and recommended products. The principle of closure is subtly used in rounded image frames and containers, where the human eye perceives complete shapes even when they are partially enclosed. The figure and ground principle is applied by keeping product images bright and colorful against clean white backgrounds, allowing items to stand out clearly. Finally, the principle of common region is achieved by using bordered or shaded cards to group information—such as product name, price, and “Add to Cart” button—within a single visual boundary, making the interface clean and well-structured.

**5. UI Elements & Design Patterns Used**

The GOWSMART interface incorporates several key UI elements and design patterns that enhance usability and maintain visual consistency. The navigation bar is placed at the bottom of the mobile app for easy thumb access, while on the web version it appears as a top header with quick links to categories, cart, and profile. Card layouts are extensively used to display grocery products and special offers, ensuring clarity and visual separation.

 **6. Usability & Interaction Principles**

* **Consistency:** Uniform colors, icons, and typography.
* **Feedback:** Micro-interactions for clicks and actions.
* **Accessibility:** High contrast, readable fonts, and alt text for images.
* **Error Prevention:** Confirmations for cart removal or checkout.
* **Efficiency:** Quick search, filters, and repeat-order shortcuts.

**7. Tools Used**

* **Design Tool:** Figma and Canva (for layouts and logo)
* **Prototyping Tool:** Figma (for mobile and web wireframes)
* **Branding Tool:** Canva (for logo and color palette)


**8. Outcome**

The final design of **GOWSMART** delivers a visually appealing and highly usable grocery shopping experience that blends **Gestalt-based layout clarity** with **modern UI design patterns**.
It ensures users can browse, select, and purchase with minimal friction — a true **“Smart Grocery”** experience.
